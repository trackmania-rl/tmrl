# === Environment ======================================================================================================

# Environment class:

env_cls = partial(GenericGymEnv, id="Pendulum-v1", gym_kwargs={"render_mode": None})

# Observation and action space:

dummy_env = env_cls()
act_space = dummy_env.action_space
obs_space = dummy_env.observation_space

print(f"action space: {act_space}")
print(f"observation space: {obs_space}")


# Now that we have defined our environment, let us train an agent with the generic TMRL pipeline.
# TMRL pipelines have a central communication Server, a Trainer, and one to several RolloutWorkers.


# === TMRL Server ======================================================================================================

# The TMRL Server is the central point of communication between TMRL entities.
# The Trainer and the RolloutWorkers connect to the Server.

security = None  # This is fine for secure local networks. On the Internet, use "TLS" instead.
password = cfg.PASSWORD  # This is the password defined in TmrlData/config/config.json

server_ip = "127.0.0.1"  # This is the localhost IP. Change it for your public IP if you want to run on the Internet.
server_port = 6666  # On the Internet, the machine hosting the Server needs to be reachable via this port.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Instantiating a TMRL Server is straightforward.
    # More arguments are available for, e.g., using TLS. Please refer to the TMRL documentation.
    my_server = Server(security=security, password=password, port=server_port)


# === TMRL Worker ======================================================================================================

# TMRL RolloutWorkers are responsible for collecting training samples.
# A RolloutWorker contains an ActorModule, which encapsulates its policy.

# ActorModule:

# SquashedGaussianMLPActor processes observations through an MLP.
# It is designed to work with the SAC algorithm.
actor_module_cls = partial(SquashedGaussianMLPActor)

# Worker local files

weights_folder = cfg.WEIGHTS_FOLDER
model_path = str(weights_folder / (my_run_name + ".tmod"))  # Current model will be stored here.
model_path_history = str(weights_folder / (my_run_name + "_"))
model_history = -1  # let us not save a model history.

# Instantiation of the RolloutWorker object:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_worker = RolloutWorker(
        env_cls=env_cls,
        actor_module_cls=actor_module_cls,
        sample_compressor=None,
        device="cpu",
        server_ip=server_ip,
        server_port=server_port,
        password=password,
        max_samples_per_episode=1000,
        model_path=model_path,
        # model_path_history=model_path_history,  # not used when model_history is -1
        model_history=model_history,
        crc_debug=CRC_DEBUG)

    # Note: at this point, the RolloutWorker is not collecting samples yet.
    # Nevertheless, it connects to the Server.


# === TMRL Trainer =====================================================================================================

# The TMRL Trainer is where your training algorithm lives.
# It connects to the Server, to retrieve training samples collected from the RolloutWorkers.
# Periodically, it also sends updated policies to the Server, which forwards them to the RolloutWorkers.

# TMRL Trainers contain a Training class. Currently, only TrainingOffline is supported.
# TrainingOffline notably contains a Memory class, and a TrainingAgent class.
# The Memory is a replay buffer. In TMRL, you are able and encouraged to define your own Memory.
# This is how you can implement highly optimized ad-hoc pipelines for your applications.
# Nevertheless, TMRL also defines a generic, non-optimized Memory that can be used for any pipeline.
# The TrainingAgent contains your training algorithm per-se.
# TrainingOffline is meant for asynchronous off-policy algorithms, such as Soft Actor-Critic.

# Trainer local files:

weights_folder = cfg.WEIGHTS_FOLDER
checkpoints_folder = cfg.CHECKPOINTS_FOLDER
model_path = str(weights_folder / (my_run_name + "_t.tmod"))
checkpoints_path = str(checkpoints_folder / (my_run_name + "_t.tcpt"))

# === Running the pipeline =============================================================================================

# Now we have everything we need.
# Typically, you will run your TMRL Server, Trainer and RolloutWorkers in different terminals / machines.
# But for simplicity, in this tutorial, we run them in different threads instead.
# Note that the Server is already running (it started running when instantiated).


# Separate threads for running the RolloutWorker and Trainer:


def run_worker(worker):
    # For non-real-time environments, we can use the run_synchronous method.
    # run_synchronous enables synchronizing RolloutWorkers with the Trainer.
    # More precisely, it enables limiting the number of collected steps per worker per model update.
    # initial_steps is the number of environment steps performed before waiting for the first model update.
    # max_steps_per_update is the RolloutWorker synchronization ratio (max environment steps per model update).
    # end_episodes relaxes synchronization: the worker run episodes until they are terminated/truncated before waiting.

    # collect training samples synchronously:
    worker.run_synchronous(test_episode_interval=10,  # collect one test episode every 10 train episodes
                           initial_steps=100,  # initial number of samples
                           max_steps_per_update=10,  # synchronization ratio of 10 environment steps per training step
                           end_episodes=True)  # wait for the episodes to end before updating the model


def run_trainer(trainer):
    trainer.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":

    daemon_thread_worker = Thread(target=run_worker, args=(my_worker, ), kwargs={}, daemon=True)
    daemon_thread_worker.start()  # start the worker daemon thread

    run_trainer(my_trainer)

    print("Training complete. Lazily sleeping for 1 second so that our worker thread blocks...")
    time.sleep(1.0)

    print("Rendering the trained policy.")

    rendering_worker = RolloutWorker(
        standalone=True,
        env_cls=partial(GenericGymEnv, id="Pendulum-v1", gym_kwargs={"render_mode": "human"}),
        actor_module_cls=partial(SquashedGaussianMLPActor),

        max_samples_per_episode=1000,
        model_path=model_path)

    rendering_worker.run_episodes()
